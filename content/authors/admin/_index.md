Welcome to my corner of the web!

My research investigates the intersection of marketing, misinformation, and social impact issues. In my primary stream of research, I test market-level interventions that help consumers better discern between true and false news, and ultimately, encourage the sharing of more true information. In a secondary stream of research, I explore how consumers react to other social issues such as the marketing of diversity and inclusion, and environmental social governance. 

As an educator, I have experience teaching students of all ages across a variety of educational environments. I have taught young students (elementary and middle schoolers), young-adults (undergraduate business school students), and I have assisted graduate courses for professionals (part-time Executive MBAs and full-time MBAs). To me, teaching and mentorship are essential to being a well-rounded academic. 

Prior to joining the Questrom School of Business, I worked as a behavioral researcher at Duke University's Social Science Research Institute. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) in 2014 with a degree in psychology (B.S.), economics (B.A.), and a minor in Hebrew language.
