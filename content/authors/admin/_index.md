**Welcome to my corner of the web!**

Can marketing science be leveraged to address important social issues facing consumers? This is the central question motivating my research and academic career, which has focused on the intersection of marketing, consumer behavior, and social impact. In my job market paper, I study a decentralized platform-level intervention that increases the sharing of true news, reduces the sharing of false news, and enhances perceptions of news accuracy. In other work, I examine other contemporary social issues facing consumers such as equity and environmental social governance.

As an educator, I have experience teaching students across a variety of educational environments. I have taught young students (elementary and middle schoolers), young-adults (undergraduate business school students), and I have assisted graduate courses for professionals (part-time and full-time MBAs). I believe teaching and mentorship are essential to being a well-rounded academic. 

Prior to joining the Questrom School of Business, I worked as a behavioral researcher at Duke University's Social Science Research Institute. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) in 2014 with a degree in psychology (B.S.) and economics (B.A.).
